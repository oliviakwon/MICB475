# P09 - Aim 4: Predict metabolic pathways and compare their relative expression among the levels within each significant variable

## Mar 12, 2024

## Purpose:
To perform a functional analysis to predict what metabolic pathways are enriched or depleted in relation to the significant variable(s) linked to gut microbiome dysbiosis identified in aim 1

## Material: 
1. picrust2 qiime2 plugin
2. rep-seq.qza, table-no-mitochondria-no-chloroplast.qzv (from qiime2)
3. R & Rstudio

## Method:

#### Functional analysis using qiime2-picrust2 plugin on server:

1. Remove ASVs in table.qza with frequency < 5, generate feature-frequency-filtered-table.qza 
2. Run PICRUSt2 analysis and output a directory that contains files with functional information

#### Downstream Analysis in RStudio

3. Convert pathway_abundance.qza into human readable files (featur_table.biome -> feature_table.biome.tsv)
4. In RStudio, load ggpicrust2 (version 1.7.3) package (34) and its dependencies
5. Load the pathway abundance table (feature_table.biome.tsv) and metadata
6. Since our chosen variable(s) from aim 1 is _____, filter the metadata accordingly
7. Remove NAs for the metadata column of interest, filter the abundance table to contain samples that also exist in the filtered metadata
8. Perform differential abundance analysis (DAA) using DESeq2, and annotate MetaCyc pathway to create an annotated dataframe\
9. Filter p < 0.05 to keep only significant data
10. Generate a heatmap, volcano plot, PCA plot, and bar plot (representing log2FoldChange of each pathway)
