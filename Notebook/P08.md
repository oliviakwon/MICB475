# P08 - Aim 3: Determine taxa/species that could be predictors of the chosen variable(s) and compare ASV abundances to a reference

## March 11, 2024

### Purpose:
To perform Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) and Differential Abundance Analysis (DESeq2) on the mouse familial dysautonomia dataset to identify specific microbes or groups of microbes that are significantly associated with different states or levels within the variable.

### Material: 
1. R & Rstudio
2. FD_rare_only_separate.Rdata (phylosesq object)

### Method 
1. Load the phyloseq object from aim 1
2. Subset the metadata with no control data
3. Glom the phyloseq object for the chosen taxonomic level 
4. Calculate indicator values for all the ASVs, summarize the results table and filter out non-significant values (p>0.05)
5. Combine taxonomic information with the list of indicator species
6. Save the final ISA table for export
7. Repeat this process for significant variables (Age.New.Bin, Sex)

### Results:
