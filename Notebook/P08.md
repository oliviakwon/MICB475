# P08 - Aim 3: Determine taxa/species that could be predictors of the chosen variable(s) and compare ASV abundances to a reference

March 11, 2024

## Purpose:
To perform Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) and Differential Abundance Analysis (DESeq2) on the mouse familial dysautonomia dataset to identify specific microbes or groups of microbes that are significantly associated with different states or levels within the variable.

## Material: 
1. R & Rstudio
2. FD_final_only_separate.Rdata (phylosesq object)

## Method 
### Indicator Species Analysis
1. Load the phyloseq object from aim 1
2. Subset the metadata with no control data
3. Glom the phyloseq object for the chosen taxonomic level 
4. Calculate indicator values for all the ASVs, summarize the results table and filter out non-significant values (p<0.05 and stat>0.80)
5. Combine taxonomic information with the list of indicator species
6. Save the final ISA table for export
7. Repeat this process for significant variables (Age.New.Bin, Sex)

## Output files:
1. ASV tables

## Results: 
Indicator Species Results table for Variable Age.New.Bin:

## Method 
### Differential Expression sequence analysis
1. Load the phyloseq object from aim 1
2. Create a new column with genotype and age called Genotype_Age
3. Subset the new column into age categories (young, middle, old)
4. Convert the phyloseq object into a DESeq object
5. Transform sample ASVs into relative abundance and add 1 to each count if encountering a zeros error
6. Create a matrix of differential abundance, with an assigned reference group (control).
   
## Output files:
1. Volcano plots
2. Bar plots of DESeq results

## Method 
### Indicator Species Analysis on variable Sex
1. Load the phyloseq object from aim 1 (FD_final_only_separate.Rdata (phylosesq object before rarefaction))
2. Subset the metadata with no control data
3. Glom the phyloseq object at ASV level 
4. Calculate indicator values for all the ASVs, summarize the results table and filter out non-significant values (p<0.05 and stat>0.80)
5. Combine taxonomic information with the list of indicator species
6. Save the final ISA table for export
   
### Differential Expression sequence analysis on variable Sex
1. Load the phyloseq object from aim 1 (FD_final_only_separate.Rdata (phylosesq object before rarefaction))
3. Subset the sample into Male and Female
4. Convert the phyloseq object into a DESeq object
5. Transform sample ASVs into relative abundance and add 1 to each count if encountering a zeros error
6. Create a matrix of differential abundance, with an assigned reference group (female = control).
7. Format the graph to be visually aesthetic and easy to understand (appropriate labels, color coding)

## Discussion:
1. Indicator Species Analysis revealed 8 ASVs strongly associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis in male FD mice. 3 of these 8 are from class Clostridia, which may have relation to their function on gut microbiota or disease. Female mice did not display any signature species.
2. DESeq displayed 10 genera that differed in abundance between male and female mice, with 4 downregulated and 6 upregulated in male. Of these genera, _Anaeroplasma_, showed -23 log2FoldChange in males compared to females. 


## Future directions:
Further research on these identified genera can be done to relate their function to Familial Dysautonomia. Functional analysis can be performed to investigate the potential role of these indicator species in gut microbiota, and their relationship to the up or downregulated functional pathways.
