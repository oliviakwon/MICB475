# P08 - Aim 3: Determine taxa/species that could be predictors of the chosen variable(s) and compare ASV abundances to a reference

## March 11, 2024

### Purpose:
To perform Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) and Differential Abundance Analysis (DESeq2) on the mouse familial dysautonomia dataset to identify specific microbes or groups of microbes that are significantly associated with different states or levels within the variable.

### Material: 
1. R & Rstudio
2. FD_rare_only_separate.Rdata (phylosesq object)

### Method 
#### Indicator Species Analysis
1. Load the phyloseq object from aim 1
2. Subset the metadata with no control data
3. Glom the phyloseq object for the chosen taxonomic level 
4. Calculate indicator values for all the ASVs, summarize the results table and filter out non-significant values (p<0.05 and stat>0.80)
5. Combine taxonomic information with the list of indicator species
6. Save the final ISA table for export
7. Repeat this process for significant variables (Age.New.Bin, Sex)

### Output files:
1. ASV tables

### Results: 
Indicator Species Results table for Variable Age.New.Bin:

### Method 
#### Differential Expression sequence analysis
1. Load the phyloseq object from aim 1
2. Create a new column with genotype and age called Genotype_Age
3. Subset the new column into age categories (young, middle, old)
4. Convert the phyloseq object into a DESeq object
5. Transform sample ASVs into relative abundance and add 1 to each count if encountering a zeros error
6. Create a matrix of differential abundance, with an assigned reference group (control).
   
### Output files:
1. Volcano plots
2. Bar plots of DESeq results

### Results: 
Volcano plot for young FD mice vs young control mice:
