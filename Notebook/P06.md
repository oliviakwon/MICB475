# P06 - Aim 1: Identify which variables are significantly associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis in mice

Feb 28, 2024

## Purpose:
To perform a univariate regression on the mouse familial dysautonomia dataset to identify which variables are significantly associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis in mice

## Material: 
1. R & Rstudio
2. Phyloseq object (ASV matrix and metadata)

## Method:
1. Import libraries: tidyverse, phyloseq, vegan, and ggplot2
2. Load phyloseq object after filtering and rarification
3. Convert ASV matrix from phyloseq object into a dataframe
4. Convert metadata from phyloseq object into a dataframe
5. Filter the metadata to only keep variables that are related to gut microbiome dysbiosis(Sample.Name, Age.Months, Age.Days, Age.New.Bin, Test.Age.New.Bin, Age.Bin, Cage.ID, Experiment.Group, Genotype, Mouse.ID, Mut.Control.Ratio, Phenotype.score, FD.severity, Test.FD.severity, Disease.Bin, Sex, Treatment.type, Weight.grams)
6. Create For Loops to iterate over each variable in the metadata, remove missing data, filter out NA values, calculate a dissimilarity matrix based on Bray-Curtis distance, and perform the PERMANOVA statistical analysis test to generate R-squared statistic and p-value in a results table.
7. Adjust p-values
8. Filter the result table to include only significant variables with Padjust < 0.05
9. Generate a bar plot using ggplot2 to visualize the R-squared values for each significant variable

## Output files:
1. Results table
2. Filtered results table
3. Results bar plot

## Method:
1. Import libraries: tidyverse, phyloseq, vegan, and ggplot2
2. Filter phyloseq object to keep treatment type == Separate and experiment group == general and cohouse
3. Load phyloseq object after filtering and rarification
4. Convert ASV matrix from phyloseq object into a dataframe
5. Convert metadata from phyloseq object into a dataframe
6. Filter the metadata to only keep variables that are related to gut microbiome dysbiosis(Sample.Name, Age.New.Bin, Cage.ID, Experiment.Group, Genotype, Mouse.ID, Phenotype.score, FD.severity, Sex, Weight.grams)
7. Create For Loops to iterate over each variable in the metadata, remove missing data, filter out NA values, calculate a dissimilarity matrix based on Bray-Curtis distance, and perform the PERMANOVA statistical analysis test, controlling for cage ID, to generate R-squared statistic and p-value in a results table.
8. Adjust p-values
9. Filter the result table to include only significant variables with Padjust < 0.05
10. Generate a bar plot using ggplot2 to visualize the R-squared values for each significant variable

## Discussion:
Numerous variables contributed to significant changes in beta diversity. Some variables fell within the same category, such as Age.Months, Age.Days, Age.New.Bin, Age.bin, and Test.Age.New.Bin. As a collective, we determined the category that would yield the most informative data. In the case of Age, we opted for Age.New.Bin, which categorizes age into young, middle, and old. A similar approach was taken for FD severity and test.FD.severity. This led to our variable list from list 1: Sample.Name, Age.Months, Age.Days, Age.New.Bin, Test.Age.New.Bin, Age.Bin, Cage.ID, Experiment.Group, Genotype, Mouse.ID, Mut.Control.Ratio, Phenotype.score, FD.severity, Test.FD.severity, Disease.Bin, Sex, Treatment.type, Weight.grams, to list 2: Sample.Name, Age.Months, Age.Days, Age.New.Bin, Test.Age.New.Bin, Age.Bin, Cage.ID, Experiment.Group, Genotype, Mouse.ID, Mut.Control.Ratio, Phenotype.score, FD.severity, Test.FD.severity, Disease.Bin, Sex, Treatment.type, Weight.grams.

Our analysis revealed that Cage ID and Experiment group emerged as the most influential variables regarding beta diversity shifts. Upon closer examination, we noticed that Cage ID encompassed numerous levels, suggesting it may act as a confounding variable requiring control. Within the Experiment group, there were three distinct categories: cohouse, general, and succinate, which further divided into separate and cohoused treatment types. It became evident that Experiment group also played a significant role in beta diversity alterations, likely due to the observed effects of cohousing on gut microbiome dysbiosis mitigation, as supported by previous research (1). Hence, further investigation is warranted on these two variables to delve deeper and extract more informative insights into which factors significantly influence beta diversity.

The next step we took was to filter the phyloseq objects for first, separate treatment type, and then, general and cohouse experiment groups. Then, we looped through the variables (list 2) in the metadata. Within this loop, in the PERMANOVA statistical analysis line, we inserted code to control for Cage ID effects. Through these changes, a new bar plot was generated indicating the following significant variables from most significant to least: Cage ID, FD severity, Age, Sex, Experiment group, Weight (g), and Genotype.

## Future direction:
Choose a variable that significantly contributes to gut microbiome dysbiosis in mice and examine the microbial taxa and diversity. This will be achieved through alpha diversity and beta diversity analyses, generation of plots, and statistical analyses.
