# P07 - Aim 2: Examine microbial taxa and diversity on the chosen variable, Age, that significantly correlate to bacterial composition

 March 3rd, 2024

## Purpose:
To perform relative abundance plot, alpha and beta diversity metrics on the mouse familial dysautonomia dataset to determine the microbial dynamics across mouse age.

## Material: 
1. R & Rstudio
2. FD_rare_only_separate.Rdata (phylosesq object)

## Codes:
* alpha diversity: [Aim2_age_alpha_v2](/R_Project/Aim2/Aim2_age_alpha_v2.txt)
* beta diversity: [Aim2_beta](/R_Project/Aim2/Aim2_beta.txt)


## Method 
### relative abundance plot:
1. Import libraries: phyloseq, ggplot2, dplyr, reshape2, and tibble
2. Subset the phyloessq object by metadata categories -> FD_phyloseq_subset
3. Create a dataframe for the phyloseq subset
4. Convert absolute ASV reads into relative abundance for each sample in the otu table, and melt the dataframe 
5. Combine the tax and otu table by the ASV column
6. Subset the sample data with sample name and age only, then combine it with the combined tax and otu table by ASV column
7. Use ggplot to plot the relative abundance plot (x = sample name, y = relative abundance, color = phylum, stratified by age)

### Alpha diversity (Chao1, Shannon):
1. In FD_phyloseq_subset, transform sample counts to integer
2. Melt the metric dataset
3. Plot ggplot (x = age, y = metric)

### Beta diversity (Bray-Curtis, Jaccard):
1. Import libraries: phyloseq, ggplot2, dplyr, reshape2, vegan, and tibble
2. Subset the phyloessq object by metadata categories -> FD_phyloseq_subset
3. Factor the sample dataset to ensure the order of age
4. Create ordination for metric (parameter = PCoA, na.rm = T)
5. Plot the metric ordination (color = age)
6. Perform Permanova on each metric (dist.metric ~ Age,data=data)

## Results:

## Discussion:
### Alpha diversity 
#### Relative abundance:
* Decreasing Bacteriodota but lower Firmicutes as mouse age increases.
#### Chao1:
*	The difference in number of species across that of the young, middle, and old mice was not significantly different.
#### Shannon:
*	Despite the median of the Shannon index increased from young, middle, to old mice, the difference in species distribution across that of the young, middle, and old mice was not significantly different. 


### Beta diversity
#### Bray-Curtis:
*	22.8% of variance explained by axis 1 and 15.8% explained by axis 2.
*	The axis 1 variation likely to explain by the microbial composition difference between mice in middle and old age, while some young mice are more similar to the old or middle. 
*	In axis 2, samples from all ages are overlapping, hence age is not the factor to explain the variation in this axis.
*	The permanova result suggests that the microbial composition of mice significantly correlated with their age.
*	More specifically, post hoc test indicated that the composition dissimilarity between middle and young mice (padujst =0.006) or old and young mice (padujst = 0.012) was significant. 
#### Jaccard:
*	16.6% of variance explained by axis 1 and 11.8% explained by axis 2.
*	The axis 1 variation likely to explain by the difference in microbes present between mice in middle and old age, while some young mice are more similar to the old or middle. 
*	In axis 2, samples from mice at young and old are overlapping, while the presence/ absence of microbe shifts across axis 2.
*	The permanova result suggests that the presence of microbial members in mice significantly correlated with their age. 

## Future direction:
* Calculate Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity, Pielou's Evenness Index on Age for alpha diversity and Unifrac Index, Weighted Unifrac Index on Age for beta diveristy
* Visualize the data by PCoA plots

## Discussion:
### Alpha diversity 
* Shannon:
    * The p-value of 0.331 shows that the distribution of bacterial species across young, middle, and old mice was not significantly different in terms of abundance.
* Chao1:
    * The p-value of 0.3432 shows that the distribution of bacterial species across young, middle, and old mice was not significantly different in terms of species richness.
* Pielou's evenness
    * The p-value of 0.331 shows that the distribution of bacterial species across young, middle, and old mice was not significantly different in terms of evenness.
* Faith's phylogenetic diversity
    * The p-value of 0.4484 shows that the distribution of bacterial species across young, middle, and old mice was not significantly different in terms of richness.

### Beta diversity
* Unweighted unifrac
   * 13.6% of variance is explained by axis 1 and 13.2% explained by axis 2.
   * Young, middle and old mice distribute differently along both axis 1 and axis 2. This suggests that each of the young, middle and old population hold different microbial species.
   * Permanova and post-hoc test result suggest species presence and abundance significantly correlate with mice age. 
* Weighted unifrac
   * 39.5% of variance is explained by axis 1 and 22.9% explained by axis 2.
   * The young- and middle- age mice samples overlap along both axes. This is likely the result of similar species presence and abundance between the young- and middle- age mice samples.
   * The old population overlapped with the young and middle age mice samples along Axis 2, but clustered at the left side of the young and middle age samples. This is likely the result of the dissimilarities between the old and the young-/middle- age mice samples.
   * Permanova and post-hoc test result suggest species presence and abundance significantly correlate with mice age.

## Discussion:
#### Sex - Bray curtis
*	22.8% of variance explained by axis 1 and 15.8% explained by axis 2.
*	Sex distinctly clustered by axis 1, which might explain the microbial composition variations in axis 1. 
*	In addition, the permanova result suggests that the microbial composition of mice significantly correlated with mouse sexes.
#### genotype - Bray curtis
*	22.8% of variance explained by axis 1 and 15.8% explained by axis 2.
*	Neither the axis 1 or 2 variation can be explained by the microbial composition difference by mouse genotype.
*	However, the permanova result suggests that the microbial composition of mice significantly correlated with mouse weights.
*	This indicated that the variation that likely to be explained by mouse weights is not first or second axis of the PCoA but can be potentially explained by any one of the axes following axis 1 or 2 (eg., axis 3 or 4, etc).

#### Weight - Bray curtis

*	Neither the axis 1 or 2 variation can be explained by the microbial composition difference by mouse weights.

## Discussion
#### relative abundance
* more Bacteriodota but less Firmitues in female compared to male mice
#### alpha diversity - sex
* shannon, Chao1, Pielou's eveness, and Faith's phylogenetic diversity: no significant difference in these diveristy metrics between sexes
#### beta diversity - sex
* Bray curtis, Jaccard, and weighted unifrac: sexes had distinct cluster along axis 1, suggesting that sexes might be able explain the microbial variations in axis 1. Moreover, the results suggested that the variations in compositional changes, presence or absense of microbes, and phylogenetic abundance were associated with sexes
* Unweighted unifrac: sexes did not cluster along axis 1 or 2, suggesting that sex was not the main driver of phylogenetic variations
#### beta diversity - weight
* weight did not cluster along axis 1 or 2, suggesting that weight was not the main driver of microbial compositional changes
