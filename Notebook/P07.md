# P07 - Aim 2: Examine microbial taxa and diversity on the chosen variable, Age, that significantly correlate to bacterial composition

## March 3rd, 2024

## Purpose:
To perform relative abundance plot, alpha and beta diversity metrics on the mouse familial dysautonomia dataset to determine the microbial dynamics across mouse age.

## Material: 
1. R & Rstudio
2. FD_rare_only_separate.Rdata (phylosesq object)

## Method 
### relative abundance plot:
1. Import libraries: phyloseq, ggplot2, dplyr, reshape2, and tibble
2. Subset the phyloessq object by metadata categories -> FD_phyloseq_subset
3. Create a dataframe for the phyloseq subset
4. Convert absolute ASV reads into relative abundance for each sample in the otu table, and melt the dataframe 
5. Combine the tax and otu table by the ASV column
6. Subset the sample data with sample name and age only, then combine it with the combined tax and otu table by ASV column
7. Use ggplot to plot the relative abundance plot (x = sample name, y = relative abundance, color = phylum, stratified by age)

### Alpha diversity (Chao1, Shannon):
1. In FD_phyloseq_subset, transform sample counts to integer
2. Melt the metric dataset
3. Plot ggplot (x = age, y = metric)

### Beta diversity (Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, unweighted and weighted Unifrac):
1. Import libraries: phyloseq, ggplot2, dplyr, reshape2, vegan, and tibble
2. Subset the phyloessq object by metadata categories -> FD_phyloseq_subset
3. Factor the sample dataset to ensure the order of age
4. Create ordination for metric (parameter = PCoA, na.rm = T)
5. Plot the metric ordination (color = age)
6. Perform Permanova on each metric (dist.metric ~ Age,data=data)

## Output files:
### Alpha diversity
1. Results stacked bar plot and boxplots
### Beta diversity
2. Results PCoA plots
3. Permanova stats table

## Results:

## Discussion:

### Alpha diversity 

#### Chao1:
*	The difference in number of species across that of the young, middle, and old mice was not significantly different.

#### Shannon:
*	Despite the median of the Shannon index increased from young, middle, to old mice, the difference in species distribution across that of the young, middle, and old mice was not significantly different. 


### Beta diversity

#### Bray-Curtis:
*	22.8% of variance explained by axis 1 and 15.8% explained by axis 2.
*	The axis 1 variation likely to explain by the microbial composition difference between mice in middle and old age, while some young mice are more similar to the old or middle. 
*	In axis 2, samples from all ages are overlapping, hence age is not the factor to explain the variation in this axis.
*	The permanova result suggests that the microbial composition of mice significantly correlated with their age.
*	More specifically, post hoc test indicated that the composition dissimilarity between middle and young mice (padujst =0.006) or old and young mice (padujst = 0.012) was significant. 

#### Jaccard:
*	16.6% of variance explained by axis 1 and 11.8% explained by axis 2.
*	The axis 1 variation likely to explain by the difference in microbes present between mice in middle and old age, while some young mice are more similar to the old or middle. 
*	In axis 2, samples from mice at young and old are overlapping, while the presence/ absence of microbe shifts across axis 2.
*	The permanova result suggests that the presence of microbial members in mice significantly correlated with their age.
