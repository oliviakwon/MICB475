# P07 - Aim 1: Identify which variables are significantly associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis in mice

Feb 29, 2024

## Purpose:
To perform a univariate regression on the mouse familial dysautonomia dataset to identify which variables are significantly associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis in mice

## Material: 
1. R & Rstudio
2. Phyloseq object (ASV matrix and metadata)

## Method:
1. Import libraries: tidyverse, phyloseq, vegan, and ggplot2
2. Filter phyloseq object to keep treatment type == Separate and experiment group == general and cohouse
3. Load phyloseq object after filtering and rarification
4. Convert ASV matrix from phyloseq object into a dataframe
5. Convert metadata from phyloseq object into a dataframe
6. Filter the metadata to only keep variables that are related to gut microbiome dysbiosis(Sample.Name, Age.New.Bin, Cage.ID, Experiment.Group, Genotype, Mouse.ID, Phenotype.score, FD.severity, Sex, Weight.grams)
7. Create For Loops to iterate over each variable in the metadata, remove missing data, filter out NA values, calculate a dissimilarity matrix based on Bray-Curtis distance, and perform the PERMANOVA statistical analysis test, controlling for cage ID, to generate R-squared statistic and p-value in a results table.
8. Adjust p-values
9. Filter the result table to include only significant variables with Padjust < 0.05
10. Generate a bar plot using ggplot2 to visualize the R-squared values for each significant variable

## Discussion:


## Future direction:
Choose a variable that significantly contributes to gut microbiome dysbiosis in mice and examine the microbial taxa and diversity. This will be achieved through alpha diversity and beta diversity analyses, generation of plots, and statistical analyses.
