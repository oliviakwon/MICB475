Main questions for Feb 8 meeting:
- Ask about the workflow we have rn (QIIME2 and R analysis) → is there anything we need to add/cut
- Do we need to re-train the phylogenetic data from the server? 
- Refraction: What rarefaction depth will you choose for your diversity analyses? How many samples are discarded at this rarefaction depth? Do we need it for every category?

Other Meeting Minutes:
* Main research question : Which variable affects the microbiome composition in mice the most and how does it impact the microbial dynamics (regression analysis - univariant) 

* QIIME2 data QC:
    * Demultiplexing the 16s rRNA
    * Train classifier (SILVA) - the mouse data already in V3 and 4; compare the primers to see if the regions match up → if yes, we could use the phylogenetic data from server
        *  V4: the 515F primer (GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 806R primer (GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT) were used for amplification 
    * We could reference everything from the UJEMI paper
* R analysis: 
    * Aim 1: Univariate Regression analysis to find significant variables that correlate with FD
        * Y value = bray curtis → based on 16S
        * X value = any category 
        * P value → table (with all variables) and 1 correlation figure with variable the most significant 
    * Aim 2: Perform diversity analysis on the chosen variable(s)
        * Richness and evenness based on 
        * Diversity matrix
    * Aim 3 (if time permits): Differential abundance analysis (genus) & Indicator species analysis (species)
        * Method: using DESeq2 (for differential)
        * Method: indicspecies package (species analysis)
    * Aim 4 (if time permits): Functional analysis
        * Method: PICRUSt: Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States 
            * https://picrust.github.io/picrust/
        * Metabolic pathway comparison
