# Agenda for the day

## Questions about manuscript
### Introduction
### Methods
### Results
* Beta diversity - should it be a stand-alone part, or should it be mentioned with aim 1?
* Alpha diversity - not mentioned in main figures. Should we still include it as a stand-alone part in results?
### Discussion
* Alpha diversity - unsure whether alpha diversity answers our research question
### Conclusion
### Limitations
### Future directions
### Figures and supplementary
* Do we put all figures in a separate document, or do we include the main figures in the manuscript and put the supplementary figures into a separate one?
