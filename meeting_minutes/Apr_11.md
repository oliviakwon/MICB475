# Agenda for the day

## Questions about manuscript
### Introduction
### Methods
* Data processing using the QIIME2 pipeline, should I add that "a detailed script can be found in the github repository" in the methods section?
* Univariate regression analysis - should I be thanking Chris for providing the univariate regression analysis template? If so how should I be writing this?
### Results
* Beta diversity - should it be a stand-alone part, or should it be mentioned with aim 1?
* Alpha diversity - not mentioned in main figures. Should we still include it as a stand-alone part in results?
### Discussion
* Alpha diversity - unsure whether alpha diversity answers our research question
### Conclusion
* Is this an adequate conclusion? 
### Limitations
* Go over all limitations we included - is there items that are missed?
  * Data set is collected by other research and not us
  * 
### Future directions
* Go over all future directions we included - is there items that are missed?
  * There are some observable patterns (from PCA and barplot) between male and female gut metabolites, but they are overlapping a lot in the PCA plot. Is this a potential cause of  imbalances between males and females in the datasets?
  * 
### Figures and supplementary
* Do we put all figures in a separate document, or do we include the main figures in the manuscript and put the supplementary figures into a separate one?
