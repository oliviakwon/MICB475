# Agenda for the day
## 1) Aim 4
## 2) Manuscript
### Link to the manuscript

### Questions
#### Introduction
#### Methods
* Data processing using the QIIME2 pipeline, should I add that "a detailed script can be found in the github repository" in the methods section?
* Univariate regression analysis - should I be thanking Chris for providing the univariate regression analysis template? If so how should I be writing this?
#### Results
* Beta diversity - should it be a stand-alone part, or should it be mentioned with aim 1?
* Alpha diversity - not mentioned in main figures. Should we still include it as a stand-alone part in results?
* 1. Double check analysis for aim 1 age  (figure 1)
    1. whether I need to do post hoc with padjust
    2. The format in figure legend
#### Discussion
* Alpha diversity - unsure whether alpha diversity answers our research question
* Taxonomic composition:
    1. Formating the hypothesis from aim1 with previous studies
    2. Firmicutes vs Bacteroidota ratio: we have higher Firmicutes vs Bacteroidota ratio in female MICE: previously HUMAN studies show the opposite result between sex, and also higher F/B ratio = more prone to disease
#### Conclusion
* Is this an adequate conclusion? 
#### Limitations
* Go over all limitations we included - is there items that are missed?
  * Data set is collected by other research and not us
  * 
#### Future directions
* Go over all future directions we included - is there items that are missed?
  * There are some observable patterns (from PCA and barplot) between male and female gut metabolites, but they are overlapping a lot in the PCA plot. Is this a potential cause of  imbalances between males and females in the datasets?
  * 
#### Figures and supplementary
* Do we put all figures in a separate document, or do we include the main figures in the manuscript and put the supplementary figures into a separate one?
